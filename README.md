This project was created by my colleague(Stewart:Github(GMDEEP)) and me. This website application was created React.js, Flask, Python. Javascript, HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Flux, postgreSQL, SQLAlchemy and this web application is currently hosted on herkou. This project was made with the intention to help educate people on cyrptocurrency with the hopes that they might be able to acheive financial freedom. This project utlizated data modeling to create the backend and the coingecko api to gather the information used for the backend. The Coins(/coinpage) was created with a fetch command from the coingecko api and I created a 7 day moving average graph with the information from it using google react graphs. We also created href links using fontawesome. For the articles page we used a fetch request with some stylings to create the RSS feed and we did the same thing for the events page.
